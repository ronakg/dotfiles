# My personal dotfiles setup

## Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/ronakg/dotfiles`
- `cd dotfiles`
- `./install`

## Features

### Bash

- Simple but useful bash prompt
- `vi` mode on by default

### Vim

- Designed for minimizing keystrokes
- Optimized for `C` programming
- Custom [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes) theme to my liking
- List of plugins are in [vim-plug.vim](https://github.com/ronakg/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vim-plug.vim)

### Tmux

- Asthetics designed to match with `vim-airline` theme
- Key shortcuts work in conjunction with iTerm key bindings
  * `Alt-n` to switch to window `n`
  * `Alt-arrows` to switch between panes
  * `Alt-tab` to switch to last active window (quick switch between 2 tmux windows)
